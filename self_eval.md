# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
- I struggled with the formatting of hashes. I didnt know that colons were also acceptable in hashes, and that keys could be any data type, not just strings
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
- Note taking is great. The most helpful notes are the terminal commands. I reference them often.
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
- I try to solve the problem on my own first. I assume how things will work out and assess what did/didnt happen. I find this builds confidence in what i know and lets me know what's wrong to assume. When things get really unknown, I google
